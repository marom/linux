-----ZSH------

apt install zsh

After the installation is complete, change the default shell of the root user to zsh with the chsh command below.

chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh root

Now logout from the root user, log in again, and you will get the zsh shell.

--IF NOT WORKING TRY---
chsh -s $(which zsh)
without sudo should work. If you use sudo it will change the shell not for your working user but for root

Finally, log out of your computer and log back in.

if wget or git are not installed

apt install wget git

Now download the installer script and execute it.

wget https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | zsh

--
oh-my-zsh is installed in the home directory '~/.oh-my-zsh'
Next, we need to create a new configuration for zsh. 
Copy the template .zshrc.zsh-template configuration file to the home directory .zshrc and apply the configuration by running the source command, as shown below.

cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
